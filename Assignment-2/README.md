# FEWD Week #2: Styling with CSS

This assignment is geared to challenge you to create a **single-column** landing page and apply more advanced CSS techniques to it.

**A crucial component of this assignment is to practice building based off of an existing design!**

You have some options for this assignment, but in both cases, you are asked to use the included *design_file.txt*:

- I am including an example mockup as one option for you to build from

- You may also sketch your own **single-column** page and build that

  If you go this route though, please

  - be aware that you will be building off of the site you create for the next couple of assignments
  - include a picture/copy of your mockup/wireframe/sketch with your submission
  - adhere to the *design_file.txt* by styling the corresponding element in your own page..for example, style your "logo/primary heading" instead of "Relaxr" as it is described

  ​

### Real-World Applications

- Building a website from a [design file](design_file.txt)
- Integrating advanced CSS properties
- Choosing and utilizing HTML5 structural elements
- Using `reset.css` or `normalize.css`to start your CSS from scratch without any browser styling
- Using the Box Model to style elements (padding, border, margin)
- Using the Flexbox model to layout elements in relation to their parent container

### Technical Requirements

- Use HTML5 structural elements (nav, header, footer)
- Use a CSS `Reset.css` or `Normalize.css` file in addition to your `style.css` file to style the page
- Use IDs and Classes to to select and style elements on the page
- Use at least **two flex containers**, each with at least **two flex items**
- Style your text with the **Google Fonts** provided by your style guide
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across .html and .css files and use best practices for naming IDs and Classes
- Indent nested elements to increase your code's readability

### If you choose to use the sample mockup/site, here is some background...

#### Description


A hot, new NY Tech Startup, Relaxr, has approached you to help them develop a new landing page for their company. They've handed you the [design file](design_file.txt) for the site, along with the copy and assets. You need to take these files and turn it into a landing page.
